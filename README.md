ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I think I got a working GET nad POST api route in my client and server, didnt have too much time to test it but should work.
My HTML form is working and submitting the data into the database.
I used media queries so the website is functional on all devices.
I tried to make my own dummy data in a supabase editor.
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I think I achieved all the required goals but wasnt able to expand or fix any bugs that were present.
ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Forgetting key commands like npm install and others, had to go back to the videos to remember what packages i needed to download.
